					Over the course of the 12- month quality work experience, Thabiso gained experience in Intern Developer and skills in Construction and was able to adapt well to our organisational culture. Given that both technical and soft skills are integral to the ability of an employee to contribute to the workplace, Thabiso has shown that they are willing to use the resources at their disposal for continued, lifelong learning.

                <p>
                    Thabiso is a student at Life Choices Coding Academy for 2020. During the course of six month(s), he 
has shown positive attitude towards his work and studies. He has a very strong passion with regards 
to techonology. He's work ethics are commendable. He has a strong abiity to think and work independently.

I highly recommend him for a fullstack position, with a strong focus to the backend.
